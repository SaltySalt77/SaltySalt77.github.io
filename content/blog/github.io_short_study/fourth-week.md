### Listening to html5 & css3 lectures

I have planned to learn Javascript basics, but to learn Javascript, it required some background knowledge of html5 & css3. So I started listening to html5 & css3 lectures.  The lecture I have chosen was basics of them.

I have learned about tags and comments. My goal for next week is to complete the lecture course.

### Translate image in gatsby official tutorial part.0~2

I have done it, ‘cause I promised with Haryu to translate images at the last study meeting. I decided that only one was needed to be translated, and I translated only that.

Like this.

It's embarrassing to show my work to others, but I did my best.

### Start writing post about ‘How to start a gatsby blog with gatsby starter bee’.

I will write a post about how to start a gatsby blog with gatsby starter bee. I have thought about how to write it.

I’ll show it after I uploading the post.

### Find ‘share on Facebook’ component

In this theme, the ‘share on Facebook’ button doesn’t work. So I must fix it.

Before fixing it, I should know how the function works. I have found some codes , but I could not understand how it works. I think I must learn React first.

### What’s changed on the blog.

1. Changed copyright below the blog, Jbee to hyna.
