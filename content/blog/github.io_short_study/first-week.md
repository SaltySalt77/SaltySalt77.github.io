I am writing the post in English because I can't write Korean in my development environment. If I want to write in Korean, I guess I have to write on GitHub. (Or make my development environment can write Korean.)

It was so hard to deploy the blog. I made a blog about 6times and deleted the blog about 5times. I've done that because when I deployed and went to the blog, I could just see 404 error pages. I could not confix it. So I started over.

My next goal is to make an auto-deploying workflow. And add new stuff to my blog. (ex. category page)

Thank you!
